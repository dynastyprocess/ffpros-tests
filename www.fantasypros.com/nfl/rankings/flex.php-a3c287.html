Elliott has racked up 55 opportunities while Pollard has just eight of them. If you have Pollard on your roster, don't drop him, as he's one of the most valuable bench stashes out there. The Seahawks front seven is not a particularly good unit, and they got worse when they lost Bruce Irvin this week to an ACL injury, but they've allowed a league-low 92 rushing yards through two games. Playing against Todd Gurley and Sony Michel will help, though holding those two teams to just 2.88 yards per carry is an accomplishment. That's also likely why opponents have gone with a run play just 31.3 percent of the time against the Seahawks (second-lowest mark in the league), because their secondary can be picked on. But again, Elliott isn't in the same category as Gurley or Michel. There were 10 running backs who finished as the RB14 or better against them last year, including four 30-point performances. This is a game where Prescott should shine, but you shouldn't be shocked if Elliott changes opinions on how good the Seahawks run defense actually is.","tag":null,"recommendation":null,"pos_rank":"RB1"},{"player_id":15514,"player_name":"Derrick Henry","sportsdata_id":"87c481c7-7414-43cc-82df-19ca0c2ae22e","player_team_id":"TEN","player_position_id":"RB","player_positions":"RB","player_short_name":"D.

It's disappointing to see him not crush Jacksonville, a team that he dismantled last year, but that's why they play the game, right? The vitals are good for Henry and things would look a bit different if he'd scored. The Vikings were a threating defense in recent history, but not so much anymore. The biggest losses to their run defense this offseason were defensive tackle Linval Joseph and edge rusher Everson Griffin, which hurt, but they just lost linebacker Anthony Barr last week to a torn pectoral injury. Even with him on the field, the Vikings defense has allowed 280 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns over the first two weeks. Heck, even going back to last year, they allowed five different running backs to surpass 100 yards on the ground. This is no longer a matchup to be worried about.

Meanwhile, Kamara continues to be hyper-efficient, and is the No. 2 running back in fantasy right alongside his doppelganger, Aaron Jones. The Packers run defense is nothing to be worried about, as they allowed a massive 4.86 yards per carry last year and have continued that trend in 2020 while allowing 4.87 yards per carry through two weeks. The lone issue is that running backs have totaled just 48 touches against them in the first two weeks, as they've averaged just 53.5 plays per game. But when you pair an efficient running back like Kamara against a Packers defense that's allowed 1.08 PPR points per opportunity, you get big results. Kamara has averaged two touchdowns per game to this point, and he might just get there again in Week 3. Start him as a star RB1. Murray went from 15 carries in Week 1 to just three in Week 2, which gives you all sorts of anxiety when trusting him. But we can't let one matchup dictate how we feel about a player. In a game where the Saints are 3.5-point favorites with an over\/under of 51.5 points, he should have some scoring opportunities.

Hines totaled 15 touches in a game that was close throughout with Marlon Mack in the lineup for 1.5 quarters, but then totaled one touch in a game where Mack was on injured reserve. Cool story, Colts. Meanwhile, Taylor didn't see a single carry until the mid-second quarter in Week 1, but then received 26 carries in Week 2. I really hope there's more clarity this week, as it makes no sense to me. The only explanation is that Hines doesn't have a role when the Colts are well ahead, which is why they gave Jordan Wilkins nine carries in Week 2. They're double-digit favorites this week. What happens when your offense averages 68.0 plays per game and your opponent allows 70.0 plays per game? Fantasy points, that's what. The Jets run defense has been very good under Gregg Williams, as they allowed just 3.12 yards per carry through 17 games coming into Week 2. The wheels came off against the 49ers in that game though, as they allowed a few big runs that netted 184 yards and two touchdowns on 27 carries. There's a lot to dissect here because the Jets aren't the same defense they were last year, as they've lost safety Jamal Adams and linebacker C.J. Mosley this offseason. Things can change quickly with teams trending in the direction the Jets are, so when you factor that in, combined with a 27-point team-implied total, Taylor is a must-start high-end RB2 who can reach top-five numbers if last week was a sign of things to come for the Jets. Hines is a lot trickier because the gamescript should be similar to last week's game where he got exactly one touch. It's starting to feel like a Tarik Cohen situation where you want him used more than he actually is. The Jets did allow the 11th-most fantasy points through the air to running backs last year, but again, Hines needs touches to get there. Consider him an RB4 where we hope last week was a fluke.","tag":null,"recommendation":null,"pos_rank":"RB4"},{"player_id":18283,"player_name":"Miles Sanders","sportsdata_id":"ef3ceaf4-b733-4e06-a7f4-a94fc67361c1","player_team_id":"PHI","player_position_id":"RB","player_positions":"RB","player_short_name":"M.

When playing the Bengals, the gap between running backs and quarterbacks is 24.6 fantasy points, which is the second-highest gap in the league. Despite the additions the Bengals made this offseason, they still appear to be a team you can run the ball against, as Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt showcased on primetime last week. We watched the Chargers and Browns both rack up at least 32 carries in this matchup, which bodes well for Sanders, and maybe even Scott. The Bengals allowed 19 running backs to finish as top-20 options against them last year and have allowed three of them through two games in 2020. The Eagles offensive line is a problem, but we can't pretend that the Browns or Washington have offensive lines that are great, and they were able to make it work. Start Sanders as an RB1 in this matchup. Scott touched the ball seven times in Sanders' return to the lineup, which isn't great, but what is great is the fact that it was only those two (Sanders and Scott) who touched the ball. If we get anywhere close to the 35 touches per game running backs have averaged against the Bengals here, Scott could offer last-minute RB4 value, especially in PPR formats.","tag":null,"recommendation":null,"pos_rank":"RB5"},{"player_id":16374,"player_name":"Dalvin Cook","sportsdata_id":"8960d61e-433b-41ea-a7ad-4e76be87b582","player_team_id":"MIN","player_position_id":"RB","player_positions":"RB","player_short_name":"D.

The two starting running backs who've gone against the Titans haven't had that problem, as they've both (James Robinson, Melvin Gordon) totaled at least 18 touches, and that's despite the Titans winning both those games. Titans opponents have averaged 66.5 plays per game this year, which would be a welcomed sight for all Vikings players who've been forced to be too efficient with minimal plays. The 5.15 yards per carry the Titans have allowed to this point is the fourth-highest mark in the league, though it was expected to be a strength of theirs this year with their talented front seven. Maybe the loss of interior defensive lineman Jurrell Casey matters more than most thought? There were also nine running backs who totaled at least five receptions against the Titans last year, so Cook's floor should be fine, and we all know his ceiling in this offense. Trot him back out there as a solid RB1 this week. With the Vikings not running many plays, Mattison has totaled just 14 touches through two weeks, which makes it difficult to trust him as anything more than a desperation RB5.

They've allowed just 3.41 yards per carry on the year with one touchdown on 54 carries, and it's nothing new, as they ranked as the No. 6 team against running backs last year while allowing 3.65 yards per carry. The 145.9 fantasy points they allowed on the ground ranked as the third-best behind only the Patriots and Bucs. The 181.8 PPR points they allowed through the air to running backs was a lot better, as that was the 10th-most in football. Jones has now seen at least six targets in each of the last three regular seasons he's played. If Davante Adams is out or limited, that number should be safe. This is not going to be an explosion game on the ground, but as I've been saying since this offseason, Jones is very similar to Alvin Kamara in that he's highly efficient, even if he doesn't get 20-plus touches per game like some top-tier backs.

Through two games, this backfield has averaged 32.0 touches per game. Funny enough, the Vikings running backs averaged 32.5 under Kevin Stefanski last year. Against Washington, we should see them rack up the carries, though there have been warning signs about efficiency in this matchup. Under Ron Rivera, this unit has allowed just 0.56 PPR points per opportunity to running backs, which ranks as the second-lowest mark in football through two weeks. A big part of that is due to them being one of just four teams who've yet to allow a touchdown to running backs. Now, to be fair, they played a Miles Sanders-less Eagles team in Week 1 and then Kyler Murray rushed for two touchdowns in Week 2, so we can't automatically assume they're rock stars that you can't run the ball against. Chubb and Hunt are tied, leading the league with 4.4 yards after contact, so getting to them isn't all you have to do; you still must bring them down. In a game they should be able to run the ball 30-plus times, you have to start these two. Chubb is the preferred option due to the positive gamescript and has double the carries Hunt does inside the five-yard-line, so start him as a low-end RB1.

Scoring 34 points in each of the first two games is a massive accomplishment for this team that didn't score more than 31 points in any game last year. That was legitimately the only thing I was concerned about with Jacobs coming into the season; his upside in what's been a low-scoring offense. Oddsmakers don't see that continuing this week, as the Raiders are projected for just 20.8 points against the Patriots. This isn't a great matchup, but it's much better than it was last year when the Patriots allowed just 76.1 rushing yards per game and allowed one rushing touchdown the entire season. Through two games in 2020, they've allowed 184 rushing yards and a touchdown to the combination of Dolphins and Seahawks running backs. Chris Carson was the only one who totaled more than 13 touches, and he wound up with 19.8 PPR points. The lone concern with Jacobs is his usage in the pass game. It appeared great in Week 1 when he saw a career-high six targets, but then we went back to just three targets in Week 2, reminiscent of his 2019 season. When the Raiders are six-point underdogs, that's a legitimate concern, though this is where I tell you he ran 17 pass routes in Monday's game, which was nearly double of that of Jalen Richard (10).

The Cowboys have faced a league-high 65 rushing attempts through two weeks, but they haven't allowed a whole lot of efficiency, as they've allowed just 3.40 yards per carry and 1.30 PPR points per target. That amounts to just 0.61 PPR points per opportunity to this point, which is the third-lowest mark in the league. While the Cowboys were a team to run the ball against last year, things change under a new coordinator, and Mike Nolan has apparently put more emphasis on stopping the run.

Melvin Gordon didn't hit that number in any game through his last two years with the Chargers. Want more good news for these backs? A robust 56.1 percent of the production the Panthers have allowed to skill-position players has gone to running backs. No other team in the league has a number higher than 50.2 percent. Running backs have averaged 34.9 more PPR points per game than quarterbacks have against this Panthers defense. It's a limited sample size, sure, but you get the point. They've now allowed 33 rushing touchdowns to running backs over their last 18 games, while no other team in the league has allowed more than 19 in that span. Kelley has eight carries inside the red zone, while Ekeler has four to his name. I'm still siding with Ekeler as the one to play considering his passing-game usage, but the gap is shrinking.

With that being said, Mixon has totaled just six targets on 97 pass attempts by Burrow (6.2 percent target share) while Bernard has seen 12 targets.

Their running backs amassed 55 carries and 204 yards with three rushing touchdowns over the last two weeks, and we can't pretend they have the most talented units or offensive lines. The problem here is gamescript with Mixon, as the Bengals are 6.5-point underdogs, which would not favor his role as the early-down back.

Look for them to try and stretch the field with Ridley, as the route Fuller struggled the most with in 2019 was the go route and post route, allowing over 20 yards per target on said routes.

The Ravens have not been a team to allow many passing yards (sixth-fewest in 2019), but they did allow nine plays of 40-plus yards last year, which ranked as the 12th-most. Of the eight wide receivers who scored 15-plus PPR points against the Ravens last year, seven of them were slot-heavy receivers. Hill is teetering on slot heavy, as he's taken over as the receiver who plays the most slot snaps among the Chiefs receivers at 54 percent. The Ravens slot cornerback Tavon Young tore his ACL in Week 2 and is out for the season. The Ravens are likely to tell Marlon Humphrey to do his best and hang with Hill.

The Cowboys have not been a matchup to avoid, either. Through two games, they're allowing the eighth-most fantasy points per target to wide receivers. The Cowboys cornerbacks play sides, and they flip-flopped from Week 1 to Week 2, and it seemed to screw something up with Chidobe Awuzie, because he allowed two touchdowns in his coverage.

He's run extremely well, averaging 5.0 yards per carry, and made a few shifty moves in the open field last week that led to a 28-yard receiving touchdown, but will those positive gamescripts continue? They are three-point underdogs in this game, and the Falcons have stopped the run extremely well considering their competition. Despite playing against Ezekiel Elliott and Chris Carson, they've allowed just 3.45 yards per carry through two weeks. There seem to be a variety of ways to score, though, as Carson caught two touchdowns, Elliott rushed for one, while Dak Prescott rushed for three. Montgomery is going to get the goal-line, which is the positive here, as the Bears are implied for 22 points. Where the Falcons struggle is to limit running backs through the air, as they've allowed 15-of-16 passes to be completed for 85 yards and two touchdowns. Since Dan Quinn became the Falcons coach, they've allowed an average of 6.4 receptions per game to running backs. Montgomery can have his role diminish in a highly negative gamescript, though oddsmakers have this as a close game. Plug him in as a low-end RB2 this week. Cohen is officially someone I'm worried about with just three targets through two games. Montgomery has six targets. Heck, Javon Wims has four targets. Cohen is not an early-down back who's going to grind out a high yards per carry. If he's not getting the targets, you can't use him in fantasy.

Fulton has only seen four targets in his young NFL career, which have led to three catches for 48 yards, though the one incomplete pass was an interception just last week. I did like Fulton during the draft process but going against Thielen is going to be tough for any rookie. Knowing his target share, combined with the fact that the Vikings should run a lot more plays this week, you should trust Thielen as a high-end WR2 in his matchup with the rookie.","tag":null,"recommendation":null,"pos_rank":"WR7"},{"player_id":12119,"player_name":"Mike Evans","sportsdata_id":"c48c21d9-0ae5-478c-ad34-30a660cfa9b8","player_team_id":"TB","player_position_id":"WR","player_positions":"WR","player_short_name":"M.

Since the start of last year, he's allowed 44-of-62 passing for 568 yards and four touchdowns in his coverage.

Of the fantasy production the Ravens have allowed to skill-position players, 35.6 percent of it has gone to the tight end position, which is easily the highest mark in the league, as no other team is over 28.9 percent.

The Browns don't have a shadow cornerback, but rather trust their cornerbacks to play sides. The good news for McLaurin is that he plays about 75 percent of his snaps on the left side of the formation, which is away from the Browns top cornerback Denzel Ward. He'll see Terrence Mitchell, who's played every snap on that side of the field. It's fair to say that Mitchell has been undervalued for much of his career, allowing just a 75.5 QB Rating when targeted in coverage, including allowing just 2-of-10 passing for 19 yards against the Bengals last week. But again, he's not on the level of Slay and Peterson, as proven by the four teams he's been on over the last five years.

Targets are worth 2.5x what a carry is worth, so we don't care so much about his 21 carries that went for a measly 61 yards. Fortunately, he plays for a high-powered offense that should be in scoring position often. This week may not be one of those high-scoring weeks, though. The Bears aren't a cake matchup, especially with Akiem Hicks on the field. You can go back to last year and see they allowed 4.12 yards per carry without him, but just 2.92 yards per carry with him. The Falcons are projected for 25.0 points, which bodes well for Gurley considering the Bears have not allowed a quarterback more than two passing touchdowns since back in Week 7 of 2018.

The stats will tell you that they've allowed the fifth-most fantasy points to running backs on the year, but that doesn't even begin to tell the whole story. Since Bruce Arians and Todd Bowles took over in Tampa, they've allowed just 1,027 yards on 347 carries. I'll save you the math - that's 2.96 yards per carry, easily the lowest mark in the NFL. They have, however, allowed the most fantasy points through the air to running backs in 2020, as the Saints and Panthers backfields have turned in 40.8 PPR points through the air alone. Rewind that for a minute and think... that's Alvin Kamara and Christian McCaffrey. Meanwhile Gordon has seen three targets in each of his two games, so he's not on that level. Still, he's a three-down back who's getting 80 percent of the touches, so even in a tough matchup, he should be considered a low-end RB2\/high-end RB3.

The Chargers incredible cornerback duo of Chris Harris Jr. and Casey Hayward awaits, though there's a twist to what we thought. The Chargers have deployed Harris in the slot, which means Michael Davis is starting on the perimeter. The Chargers have still allowed the third-fewest fantasy points per target (1.36) to wide receivers, and they were the fourth-best team in the league against wide receivers last year, too. It helps that they've faced just 15.8 wide receiver targets per game in that stretch. You can't bench Moore with all the targets he's getting, but you need to understand how tough of a matchup this is, knocking him down into low-end WR2 territory.

Through two games, this backfield has averaged 32.0 touches per game. Funny enough, the Vikings running backs averaged 32.5 under Kevin Stefanski last year. Against Washington, we should see them rack up the carries, though there have been warning signs about efficiency in this matchup. Under Ron Rivera, this unit has allowed just 0.56 PPR points per opportunity to running backs, which ranks as the second-lowest mark in football through two weeks. A big part of that is due to them being one of just four teams who've yet to allow a touchdown to running backs. Now, to be fair, they played a Miles Sanders-less Eagles team in Week 1 and then Kyler Murray rushed for two touchdowns in Week 2, so we can't automatically assume they're rock stars that you can't run the ball against. Chubb and Hunt are tied, leading the league with 4.4 yards after contact, so getting to them isn't all you have to do; you still must bring them down. In a game they should be able to run the ball 30-plus times, you have to start these two. Chubb is the preferred option due to the positive gamescript and has double the carries Hunt does inside the five-yard-line, so start him as a low-end RB1.

It's a shame because it was almost as if the Bucs were looking for a reason, but he gave them one when he botched the handoff leading to a turnover. Bruce Arians said after the game that he's not planning on giving the starting job to Fournette, and that he likes him to come into the game later and finish teams off. This could very easily become a Peyton Barber\/Jones situation from last year where we never seemingly know which one to start. For now, it appears that Jones hasn't lost all hope, but he's on thin ice every week, which can't be good for his mental state entering a game. The Broncos have allowed 100-yard rushers in back-to-back games to open the season, as both Derrick Henry and James Conner were able to get there. That's a big change from last year when they allowed two 100-yard rushers all season. Oddly enough, Fournette was one of them when he rattled off 225 yards on 29 carries in their Week 4 matchup. The bottom line with this matchup is that we have a lack of confidence in which running back to trust. Jones appears to be the 1A but he presents so much risk that he can't be played as anything more than a low-end RB3 with tons of risk.

The potential downside, however, is that Mayfield seemed to go into that game with a different mindset, and it was one that wasn't going to force the ball to Beckham. This is a good thing in some ways, but it could take away some of the steady targets. Going against Washington's cornerbacks is hardly a daunting task, though the pressure their front seven is bringing to the quarterback has allowed them to look better than they are. The duo of Ronald Darby and Fabian Moreau have stuck to sides, and Beckham plays on both sides of the formation, so he'll see a mixture of these two. We watched DeAndre Hopkins catch 8-of-9 targets for 68 yards and a touchdown against this secondary last week.

A robust 56.1 percent of the production the Panthers have allowed to skill-position players has gone to running backs. No other team in the league has a number higher than 50.2 percent. Running backs have averaged 34.9 more PPR points per game than quarterbacks have against this Panthers defense. It's a limited sample size, sure, but you get the point. They've now allowed 33 rushing touchdowns to running backs over their last 18 games, while no other team in the league has allowed more than 19 in that span. Kelley has eight carries inside the red zone, while Ekeler has four to his name. I'm still siding with Ekeler as the one to play considering his passing-game usage, but the gap is shrinking.

That matchup likely primed him for this one, as the Steelers have been the worst matchup for running backs since the start of 2019. Here's a fun fact: You'd have to go all the way back to Week 16 of 2018 to find the last time they allowed a top-12 performance to a running back. That's 19 straight games without allowing a running back to finish as an RB1. It's not due to a lack of trying, either, as the Steelers faced the ninth-most running back touches in 2019. Over their last 18 games, running backs have averaged a miniscule 0.65 PPR points per opportunity (carries and targets). Think about how good that is... even if Johnson were to get 20 touches, their average performance would give him 13.0 PPR points. Johnson is just a low-end RB2\/high-end RB3 who you're hoping finds the end zone similar to Melvin Gordon last week.

That's not true. Did you know the Chiefs allowed the fewest yards in the league to wide receivers last year? Will Fuller's 112 yards in Week 1 was just the second time in 18 games they've allowed a 100-yard receiver. Keep in mind there have been 15 wide receivers who've seen at least eight targets during that span. Now, with that being said, they were already down one starting cornerback to suspension, but they were also down another starting cornerback last week, as Charvarius Ward did not play through his fractured hand. There's no guarantee he plays on Monday night. That would mean fourth-round rookie L'Jarius Sneed and last year's sixth-round pick Rashad Fenton would be starting on the perimeter. That duo has allowed 25 receptions for 283 yards and three touchdowns on 43 targets over their short careers. The matchup is better than it typically is.

If he hadn't scored those two touchdowns in Week 1, he would be a running back with 83 total yards through two weeks. His role should continue to grow as the weeks go on, but he's a risky start at this moment. The Chiefs are a matchup to attack with running backs, as they've allowed 19 different running backs finish as the RB26 or better over their last 18 games.

That was the second-highest number of carries he had all season. His other two highest totals came against the Steelers and Patriots, so it's obvious they trust him in competitive situations, which this game will be. Ingram should be in lineups as a solid RB2 for this game with a good shot to score at least once. Dobbins is someone I understand the 'want' to play him more than I understand the process.

Unfortunately, the initial reaction may have been correct. Gallup has 10 targets through two games while Lamb has 15 of them. There was just one stretch of two games where Gallup had 10 targets last year, so we're officially worried. He's typically at LWR, which means he'll see the most of Quinton Dunbar, the Seahawks big acquisition at cornerback. The Seahawks as a whole have struggled to stop wide receivers, but Dunbar has been at least competent. If the last two years are a sign of anything, he's the most talented cornerback on the team. Again, this team has allowed 67.5 PPR points per game to wide receivers, so there's production to be had, but Gallup is at the stage where he almost needs to prove it before he can be trusted as a top-30 wide receiver.

He's running 81 percent of his routes from in the slot, which means he'll see veteran Lamarcus Joyner in the slot. After a rough start to his slot cornerback transition (from safety), Joyner has been solid, allowing just 9.7 yards per reception, though the 72.9 percent completion-rate is high. The best performance by a slot-heavy receiver against the Raiders since the start of last year is Keenan Allen's eight-catch, 68-yard game where he didn't even score.

Over the last 11 games Wilson has played, he's scored five touchdowns on 30 touches, which is ridiculous. That happened because 16 of his 27 carries came inside the red zone, including 10 of them inside the 10-yard line, which was 25 percent of the team's total on the season. He's clearly the favored back in the red zone. McKinnon looked good last week, rumbling for 77 yards and a touchdown on just three carries against the Jets. That's the issue right there, though. Three carries in a game they lost Mostert, and even before Coleman got hurt, he was inefficient. Still, McKinnon got three carries. He had five targets in Week 1, which is something we should be looking for with Mullens under center. He targeted running backs 49 times in his eight games, enough for a 17.9 percent target share, and they didn't have the problems they do now at wide receiver. The Giants have allowed a healthy 4.64 yards per carry through two games, and though they haven't allowed a rushing touchdown, they did allow David Montgomery to score a receiving touchdown last week. We know Kyle Shanahan's scheme works, which is why we search for running backs who will get the most touches in it. My guess here would be that Wilson gets at least 12 touches, including goal-line work. Because of that, he's my favorite play in this backfield and should be considered a middling RB3 this week. McKinnon has a much wider range of outcomes, so we need to be careful not to expect too much for a running back who's received nine touches in the last two-plus years. He has some upside, sure, but I can't say for certain he gets more than 10 opportunities, and we're expecting Wilson to get the touches that matter most.

The duo of C.J.

These two are the heartbeat of the offense. Goedert is starting to look like the preferred option, as he out-targeted Ertz once again. He now leads the duo in targets on the season, 17-14. The Bengals have an all-new linebacker group and have been without starting safety Shawn Williams, but they've been competent against tight ends to this point, allowing 7.44 yards per target with no touchdowns. It's such a small sample size, so we must go back to look at 2019 when they allowed 8.40 yards per target (fourth-most), and 1.91 PPR points per target (sixth-most) to the position. There were six tight ends who saw more than three targets against them last year, and five of them finished as top-nine options. It's safe to say you can start both of these tight ends, though Goedert might be the favorite moving forward, as he's totaled at least eight targets in four straight games dating back to last year, and has at least six targets in each of his last nine games.

His 3.6 yards per target is the 31st worst mark of all-time from wide receivers who've seen 20-plus targets. It seems every time he gets up off the ground, it's a struggle. He might be working back into game-shape after having 2019 off, which must be the hope. Until we see his efficiency rise, we have to treat him as a risky start in fantasy. Still, his ridiculous 330 air yards through two weeks leads the NFL by a full 34 percent. Take this from someone who loved Green before the season began: I have zero clue what to do. Fortunately, his matchup doesn't entice you to start him this week, as he's likely getting Darius Slay in coverage, one of the top cornerbacks in the game. Slay did move around the formation in Week 1, but then stayed firmly planted at LCB in Week 2, so it's possible we don't have a shadow situation, but I'd expect it.

Seeing seven and nine targets is encouraging; he'll bounce back.

But still, we've seen Keenan Allen get eight targets and turn them into 4\/37\/0, Mike Williams turn nine targets into 4\/69\/0, and then Odell Beckham turn six targets into 4\/74\/1.

The Cardinals haven't been a very giving team to wide receivers thus far, as the 46.9 PPR points they've allowed to them is the lowest in the league. It certainly helps that they've played just one receiver who was a legitimate threat (Terry McLaurin), and he was able to post 125 yards and a touchdown. Last year, against this defense (without Patrick Peterson, who was suspended), Jones caught 4-of-4 passes for 56 yards.

With Josh Allen dropping back to pass a lot more, it's put Brown on a path to exceed last year's 115 targets, even with Diggs on the roster. On top of that, Diggs will often draw the opponent's top cornerback in coverage, leaving Brown with a better WR\/CB matchup. The Rams have Jalen Ramsey and Darious Williams on the perimeter, but we're expecting Ramsey to shadow Diggs, which would leave Brown with Williams. He's only faced 23 career targets, but he's been promising on them, intercepting three passes while allowing one touchdown.

The downside is that the Chargers defense awaits, and they've been murderous through two weeks, allowing just 0.63 PPR points per opportunity, which ranks as the fourth-lowest number in the league. The 3.94 yards per target they've allowed is ridiculous, especially when you know they've played against Joe Mixon and Clyde Edwards-Helaire in the first two games.

A league-low 34.4 percent of skill-position players fantasy points have come from wide receivers against the Cardinals. That number was at 45.7 percent in 2019, which was below league average as well, though it certainly helped that they allowed a million points to tight ends. Golladay caught 4-of-9 passes for 42 yards and a touchdown in their Week 1 meeting last year, though that was without Patrick Peterson, who was serving a suspension. The Cardinals now have a starting cornerback duo of Peterson and Dre Kirkpatrick on the perimeter, which should be considered above average. Through two games, the duo has combined to allow 9\/113\/1 on 18 targets. Volume was paramount against this defense last year, as they allowed 19 receivers to score more than 13.1 PPR points, and 14 of them had nine or more targets. Oddly enough, they didn't allow a single multi-touchdown game to a wide receiver.

It's a very small sample size but allowing just 58 yards on 13 targets is good no matter which way you slice it. When you find out those tight ends were Darren Waller, Rob Gronkowski, and O.J.

The Bills defense has been a magnet for tight end targets, as they've seen 20 targets (third-most), which has led to them allowing 15 receptions for 170 yards and a touchdown. Those are great numbers and keep in mind that the two tight ends they played against (Mike Gesicki, Chris Herndon) have not been particularly efficient throughout their careers. Of the production they've allowed to running backs, wide receivers, and tight ends, 24.1 percent of it has been the tight ends, which ranks as the ninth-highest percentage in the league.

The Vikings are allowing more fantasy points per game than the Jaguars did, and I'm not talking about just the wide receivers. As for the receivers, the Vikings have allowed a massive 53.1 PPR points per game to them, which ranks as the second most in the league behind only the Seahawks. That's what happens when you flip your cornerback depth chart upside down. The combination of Mike Hughes and Holton Hill have allowed 19-of-24 passing for 233 yards and two touchdowns through two weeks, and they're the ones Davis will see much of the day. Much of that was done by Aaron Rodgers and the Packers receivers, but Tannehill has proven to be playing at a high level, so there's little reason to doubt he can get the ball to Davis.

The Saints had absolutely no solution for him, including Malcolm Jenkins, one of the best cover safeties out there. It's why you must wonder if the Patriots use Stephon Gilmore to cover him. The Patriots played a couple big-name tight ends last year and here were the results: Zach Ertz 9\/94\/0, Travis Kelce 7\/66\/0, and Mark Andrews 2\/21\/0. Not the worst results, but definitely could be better. The Patriots defense isn't the same, though, and have five new starters in the mix. Mike Gesicki was held to just 3\/30\/0 in Week 1 and then exploded in Week 2, so maybe it's the scheme that limits the production?

We've definitely seen \"boom\" performances from Anderson in the past but they were usually throughout the season and not back-to-back. Now having at least eight targets in two straight games to open his Panthers career, it's a good sign of things to come. Unfortunately, the Chargers are not a defense to attack with wide receivers, as they've allowed the 10th-fewest points to them in 2020, and that's coming off last season's No. 4 finish. They added Chris Harris Jr. to the mix, which certainly helps compensate for the loss of safety Derwin James on the back end, though that's where Tyreek Hill beat them last week. He'd totaled just four catches for 45 scoreless yards on 10 targets before that fourth-quarter bomb that went for a 45-yard touchdown. That's why it's so hard to sit someone like Anderson, as he also presents that one-play upside, and when he's getting eight-plus opportunities per game, the chances rise. The Chargers did allow just six pass plays of 40-plus yards last year, so it's far from a certainty.

The snaps are somewhat similar with Ingram leading the way with 48, Edwards 46, and Dobbins 43. It seems like Ingram is the one who they'll play the most when the game is close, Edwards is the closer, while Dobbins does everything in between, though that role has only led to 10 opportunities through two weeks. If he hadn't scored those two touchdowns in Week 1, he would be a running back with 83 total yards through two weeks. His role should continue to grow as the weeks go on, but he's a risky start at this moment. The Chiefs are a matchup to attack with running backs, as they've allowed 19 different running backs finish as the RB26 or better over their last 18 games. During last year's meeting, Mark Ingram exploded for 103 yards and three touchdowns on 16 carries and chipped in four receptions for 32 yards. That was the second-highest number of carries he had all season. His other two highest totals came against the Steelers and Patriots, so it's obvious they trust him in competitive situations, which this game will be. Ingram should be in lineups as a solid RB2 for this game with a good shot to score at least once. Dobbins is someone I understand the 'want' to play him more than I understand the process. He's a risky RB3\/4 option who will disappoint if he doesn't score. Edwards will have a bigger role if they blow out the Chiefs, but we're not expecting that, so he's not a recommended fantasy option.","tag":null,"recommendation":null,"pos_rank":"RB29"},{"player_id":17270,"player_name":"Dallas Goedert","sportsdata_id":"e8029983-87cf-49a2-bc04-04c8233a0630","player_team_id":"PHI","player_position_id":"TE","player_positions":"TE","player_short_name":"D.

These two are the heartbeat of the offense. Goedert is starting to look like the preferred option, as he out-targeted Ertz once again. He now leads the duo in targets on the season, 17-14. The Bengals have an all-new linebacker group and have been without starting safety Shawn Williams, but they've been competent against tight ends to this point, allowing 7.44 yards per target with no touchdowns. It's such a small sample size, so we must go back to look at 2019 when they allowed 8.40 yards per target (fourth-most), and 1.91 PPR points per target (sixth-most) to the position. There were six tight ends who saw more than three targets against them last year, and five of them finished as top-nine options. It's safe to say you can start both of these tight ends, though Goedert might be the favorite moving forward, as he's totaled at least eight targets in four straight games dating back to last year, and has at least six targets in each of his last nine games.","tag":"start","recommendation":null,"pos_rank":"TE9"},{"player_id":16460,"player_name":"Jonnu Smith","sportsdata_id":"e4f25a37-74de-4bfb-b6c9-f50a4fab0b87","player_team_id":"NE","player_position_id":"TE","player_positions":"TE","player_short_name":"J.

His 87 yards after the catch is the most among tight ends, while the closest one has 74 yards after the catch. That's my only concern with Smith, who ranks 11th among tight ends in targets. But make no mistake about it - he's a physical specimen who creates after the catch. The Vikings were the worst matchup in the league for tight ends last year, but last year seems so long ago for this defense that continually loses pieces. They lost linebacker Anthony Barr last week, and it didn't help them slow down Mo Alie-Cox who racked up six catches for 111 yards against them. There was a game last year where they allowed Darren Waller, another athletic tight end, to rack up 13 catches for 134 yards, too.

Through two games, the touch count is: Brown 32, Akers 18, Henderson 17. We may have lost one part of that timeshare in Week 2 as Akers had to leave with a rib injury. That would certainly help clear things up and make us feel better about both Brown and Henderson, as the Rams running backs have combined to average 33.5 touches per game, which is enough for two running backs to be productive. The Bills run defense isn't anything too intimidating and they were without two starting linebackers last week, though you wouldn't know it by the stat sheet. They have yet to play a running back who's totaled more than seven carries. This is what happens when you play the Jets and Dolphins over the first two weeks. If you look at them last year, they allowed a healthy 4.37 yards per carry, though the 25.6 touches per game they allowed to running backs was the eighth-lowest mark in football. I've brought this stat up before and I think it makes sense to do it again given the Rams willingness to run the ball in the red zone. Under Sean McDermott, the Bills have now allowed 46 rushing touchdowns to running backs over 50 regular season games. That averages out to 14.7 per season. By comparison, there were just five teams who allowed more than that in 2019. If Akers is ruled out, Henderson is my favorite play as a high-end RB3, though Brown is right there in a tier below (low-end RB3). They come with risk, sure, but given the number of touches going around combined with touchdown upside, it's a risk you should be willing to take. Akers is currently questionable for the game, but don't be surprised if he misses at least one week with his rib cartilage injury.","tag":null,"recommendation":null,"pos_rank":"RB30"},{"player_id":15629,"player_name":"Will Fuller V","sportsdata_id":"095e0c1a-0bea-4bc6-868f-e4bbe2ce6c30","player_team_id":"MIA","player_position_id":"WR","player_positions":"WR","player_short_name":"W.

Fantasy owners have seen this all too often with Fuller. Just one week after accounting for 51 percent of their air yards, this happens. You'll need to monitor his practice participation throughout the week, but the matchup leaves a lot to be desired. The Steelers have allowed just two wide receivers to top 100 yards against them since the start of last year. One was Tyler Boyd, who is nothing like Fuller, while the other was Darius Slayton in Week 1. Both of them saw nine targets, a number that's going to be hard for Fuller to get to if he's not 100 percent, especially now that Brandin Cooks is near full health and developing rapport with Watson. The Steelers allowed just six plays of 40-plus yards last year and none with 60-plus yards, so relying on a big play out of Fuller wouldn't make sense. You need volume, so pay attention to the practice reports. If he's practicing in full, you must consider him as a boom-or-bust WR3. If he's limited throughout the week and questionable, he moves into WR4 territory with donut potential (a zero in your lineup).

Here's a list of big-name players who saw fewer targets than that in 2019: DeVante Parker, Davante Adams, Courtland Sutton, Chris Godwin, Amari Cooper... do you catch my drift? His targets aren't worth as much as those guys, but he's a reliable player in fantasy because of his target floor. The Bears have Buster Skrine covering the slot, and while he played well in 2019, slot receivers have fared well this year. First, it was Danny Amendola racking up 5\/81\/0 on seven targets, and then it was Golden Tate catching all five of his targets for 47 yards. Again, not sexy, but worth a spot-start in such an injury-plagued week. With the Bears defending the run so well, we saw Matthew Stafford rack up 42 pass attempts while Daniel Jones hit the 40 mark. If the Falcons go down a similar path, which seems likely, Gage should be able to fill a WR4-type role on your fantasy team.

The Panthers have only seen 26 wide receiver targets through two weeks, but have allowed a massive 15.06 yards per reception on them, which is the fourth-highest mark in the league. Williams plays on both sides of the formation, so he'll see a mixture of Donte Jackson and Rasul Douglas in coverage. Jackson allowed a robust 16.9 yards per reception in his coverage last year. He has 4.32-second speed, but he's just 5-foot-10 and 180 pounds. Williams can win that matchup. Douglas certainly has better size (6-2, 209) to handle Williams, but he's slow (4.59-second speed) and allowed 15.7 yards per reception in his coverage as well. The only concern about Williams in this match is the targets. If they're there, he'll produce.

If Thomas is out, he's on the fantasy radar, and this matchup suits his role well. The Packers secondary has allowed 15.8 yards per reception to wide receivers over their last 18 games, which is more Smith's role than Emmanuel Sanders', as he's targeted down the field with more frequency. It doesn't help that Brees is throwing the ball deep (20-plus yards) on just 4.4 percent of his passes, though. That's the third-lowest mark in the league and the real issue with the ceiling for any Saints wide receiver not named Thomas.

The Bears have been pretty generous to tight ends over the first two weeks of 2020, allowing T.J. Hockenson to finish as the TE4 in Week 1, and then Evan Engram to bounce back and finish as a top-15 option in Week 2. It seems the Bears are willing to allow you to dink-and-dunk your way down the field with tight ends, as they allowed the fifth-most receptions to tight ends last year, but the 9.23 yards per reception they allowed was the second-lowest mark in football.

Their primary slot cornerback is Jamal Perry, though they benched him for Nik Needham in Week 2. That didn't fare well, so who knows which route they'll take this week. What we do know is that Cole can play a role in fantasy football and his early-season performances may not be a fluke. Knowing he has the best matchup on the field, he deserves a slight bump in the rankings. Both him and Shenault should be considered WR5 types, with Cole being the safer of the two.

The Saints perimeter cornerback duo of Marshon Lattimore and Janoris Jenkins is among the best in the NFL, so it means a lot to know that Lazard is playing 63 percent of his snaps in the slot. That will match him up with Chauncey Gardner-Johnson most of the time. He's allowed 7-of-8 passing in his coverage for 46 yards through two weeks.

The Bucs knew their safety position was one they could've upgraded, and they did, snagging Antoine Winfield Jr. in the second round. He's looked good through two weeks, and the Bucs have allowed just 14.8 PPR points to tight ends through the first two games, which ranks as the seventh fewest in the league. That's somewhat easy to do when you play against Ian Thomas and Chris Manhertz in Week 2, who combined for just one catch and eight yards. If you go back to Week 1, it was a different story with Jared Cook, who snagged 5-of-7 targets for 80 yards.

The Bucs defense is no walk in the park, either. They've continually gotten better and have allowed the 12th-fewest fantasy points to wide receivers through two weeks despite playing against the Saints and Panthers. Now, to be fair, any wide receiver who's seen more than five targets against them has finished with 100-plus receiving yards (D.J. Moore and Robby Anderson). Jeudy has seen 15 targets through two games, so with Sutton out, that number should only rise as he gains more experience. He's running 77 percent of his routes from the slot, which means he'll see second-year cornerback Sean Murphy-Bunting the most. That's a good thing, as he's allowed a 74.1 percent catch-rate in his coverage over his 18 games of experience, including four touchdowns on 81 targets. The Bucs best cornerback is Carlton Davis, who won't see Jeudy more than 20 percent of the time.

Even worse is that Swift and Johnson have gotten two carries inside the 10-yard-line while Peterson has just one, which seems like it should be Peterson's role. This is going to be an ugly backfield to predict every week, though Swift should eventually establish himself as the top option. The Cardinals have surprisingly not allowed a running back more than 56 yards on the ground through two weeks. They limited Raheem Mostert to just 56 yards on 15 carries, though he did rattle off 95 yards and a touchdown through the air. Swift is clearly the preferred receiving option, as he's been in on 39 pass snaps, while Peterson and Johnson have combined for 33. Running backs have accounted for 50 percent of fantasy production against the Cardinals, which ranks as the third-highest in the league, so if the Lions are going to come anywhere close to their 24.5-point implied total, someone is likely to have value. Swift would be my choice, but as you can see, there's no guarantee. Treat him as a low-end RB3 and hope he finds his way into the end zone or sees quite a few targets. Peterson is getting the most touches but if he's not locked into goal-line work, he won't offer much upside at all. He's nothing more than a RB4 who's got a limited ceiling.

The Steelers aren't slouches either, as they've allowed just 16 receivers to score more than 11.2 PPR points against them since the start of last year. Why is that number significant? It's the average number of points it took to finish as a top-36 receiver in 2019. That's what you're looking for when starting any wide receiver, a top-36 performance. Cooks tends to do well against slower cornerbacks, and the Steelers duo of Joe Haden and Steven Nelson kind of fit in that group. Nelson ran a 4.49 when coming into the NFL while Haden ran a 4.52, though both are slower than they were when they came into the league. It's not a great matchup, but we'd give Cooks a solid bump if Fuller can't go or is limited throughout the week. For now, we'll assume Fuller plays after being limited in practice.

But if he keeps dropping touchdowns, like he did in the Bills game, he's going to start losing even more targets to Isaiah Ford. Williams is also playing all his snaps on the perimeter, which doesn't give him many catch-and-run opportunities. The Jaguars secondary isn't one to be worried about, but you should play the wait-and-see game with Williams, as he just might not be all the way over the mental hurdle from his injury.

They've allowed 4\/44\/0 to George Kittle through essentially one half, and then allowed just 4\/26\/0 to Logan Thomas last week. You don't want to completely change your mind on the small sample size, but it's clear they've improved, as they allowed 13 tight ends to finish as top-10 options last year.

Michel has picked up right where he left off last year, averaging just 3.3 yards per carry and not catching a single pass. It's brutal, too, as Cam Newton's presence should be opening holes up for him. It's worth noting that he's faced 8-plus man defensive fronts on 41.2 percent of his carries, which is the fourth-highest mark in the league. According to NFL's NextGenStats, he's getting almost exactly what he's been expected to, though that doesn't soak up fantasy owners' tears. In a game they're six-point favorites against a team that has allowed 4.66 yards per carry and four rushing touchdowns on just 41 carries, he must be under consideration as a mid-to-low-end RB3 who comes with touchdown upside. Guys, Newton isn't going to rush for two touchdowns every game. That same Raiders team that's allowed a lot of rushing totals has allowed a massive 9.83 targets to running backs, and that's something we continually saw last year, as they allowed the fourth-most fantasy points through the air to running backs. We don't know how much White will be involved, so it's a tough week to rank him, but given the matchup, he should offer high-end RB4 value in PPR formats.

Over the last 11 games Wilson has played, he's scored five touchdowns on 30 touches, which is ridiculous. That happened because 16 of his 27 carries came inside the red zone, including 10 of them inside the 10-yard line, which was 25 percent of the team's total on the season. He's clearly the favored back in the red zone. McKinnon looked good last week, rumbling for 77 yards and a touchdown on just three carries against the Jets. That's the issue right there, though. Three carries in a game they lost Mostert, and even before Coleman got hurt, he was inefficient. Still, McKinnon got three carries. He had five targets in Week 1, which is something we should be looking for with Mullens under center. He targeted running backs 49 times in his eight games, enough for a 17.9 percent target share, and they didn't have the problems they do now at wide receiver. The Giants have allowed a healthy 4.64 yards per carry through two games, and though they haven't allowed a rushing touchdown, they did allow David Montgomery to score a receiving touchdown last week. We know Kyle Shanahan's scheme works, which is why we search for running backs who will get the most touches in it. My guess here would be that Wilson gets at least 12 touches, including goal-line work. Because of that, he's my favorite play in this backfield and should be considered a middling RB3 this week. McKinnon has a much wider range of outcomes, so we need to be careful not to expect too much for a running back who's received nine touches in the last two-plus years. He has some upside, sure, but I can't say for certain he gets more than 10 opportunities, and we're expecting Wilson to get the touches that matter most.

This doesn't seem like a matchup that fits his strengths very well, making him a mediocre WR4\/5, and that's with Thomas out of the lineup.","tag":null,"recommendation":null,"pos_rank":"WR48"},{"player_id":9683,"player_name":"Golden Tate","sportsdata_id":"c88d9352-b835-45ed-a909-1cfec09a58bc","player_team_id":"FA","player_position_id":"WR","player_positions":"WR","player_short_name":"G.

It's something to monitor. K'Waun Williams is the one Tate will see in coverage most of the time, a cornerback who's played extremely well over the last two years, allowing just 5.35 yards per target and one touchdown on 82 targets in coverage. Now, to be fair, the 49ers run a lot of zone coverage, so Tate won't always line up against him, but that could be looked at as a negative as well. On 46 Golden Tate targets against zone coverage last year, Daniel Jones had just a 69.7 QB Rating compared to 108.9 in man coverage.

The Jaguars have surprised early in the season, allowing Derrick Henry and Jonathan Taylor to combine for just 106 yards on 34 carries (3.12 yards per carry) and no touchdowns. They did allow the Colts running backs to combine for a ridiculous 17 catches for 142 yards and a touchdown in the Week 1 meeting, which clearly benefits someone like Gaskin, who has the passing-down role locked up with 11 targets through two weeks, while Breida has just two. The 7.40 yards per target the Jaguars allowed to running backs was the third-highest mark in the league, too. If you play in a PPR format, Gaskin can be considered a back-end RB3 for those dealing with injuries; just understand he doesn't come with a massive ceiling. The Jaguars have allowed at least 20 points to their opponents in nine of their last 10 games, so there should be a chance at Howard stealing a touchdown, but even then, what do you get?

It's a shame because it was almost as if the Bucs were looking for a reason, but he gave them one when he botched the handoff leading to a turnover. Bruce Arians said after the game that he's not planning on giving the starting job to Fournette, and that he likes him to come into the game later and finish teams off. This could very easily become a Peyton Barber\/Jones situation from last year where we never seemingly know which one to start. For now, it appears that Jones hasn't lost all hope, but he's on thin ice every week, which can't be good for his mental state entering a game. The Broncos have allowed 100-yard rushers in back-to-back games to open the season, as both Derrick Henry and James Conner were able to get there. That's a big change from last year when they allowed two 100-yard rushers all season. Oddly enough, Fournette was one of them when he rattled off 225 yards on 29 carries in their Week 4 matchup. The bottom line with this matchup is that we have a lack of confidence in which running back to trust. Jones appears to be the 1A but he presents so much risk that he can't be played as anything more than a low-end RB3 with tons of risk. Meanwhile, Fournette is going to get some touches, though how many depends on if Jones screws something up. Fournette should be considered a high-end RB4 who has some upside, sure, but also has a five-touch floor if Jones is running hot.","tag":null,"recommendation":null,"pos_rank":"RB36"},{"player_id":11821,"player_name":"Latavius Murray","sportsdata_id":"540f8b30-900e-4d17-8756-c262ba5fa039","player_team_id":"NO","player_position_id":"RB","player_positions":"RB","player_short_name":"L.

Murray had three carries through the first 10 minutes of that game for 14 yards, yet they went away from the run and it cost them the game. Meanwhile, Kamara continues to be hyper-efficient, and is the No. 2 running back in fantasy right alongside his doppelganger, Aaron Jones. The Packers run defense is nothing to be worried about, as they allowed a massive 4.86 yards per carry last year and have continued that trend in 2020 while allowing 4.87 yards per carry through two weeks. The lone issue is that running backs have totaled just 48 touches against them in the first two weeks, as they've averaged just 53.5 plays per game. But when you pair an efficient running back like Kamara against a Packers defense that's allowed 1.08 PPR points per opportunity, you get big results. Kamara has averaged two touchdowns per game to this point, and he might just get there again in Week 3. Start him as a star RB1. Murray went from 15 carries in Week 1 to just three in Week 2, which gives you all sorts of anxiety when trusting him. But we can't let one matchup dictate how we feel about a player. In a game where the Saints are 3.5-point favorites with an over\/under of 51.5 points, he should have some scoring opportunities.

That started when Campbell exited last week and allowed Pittman to see six targets in Week 2, which may not sound like much, but it led the wide receivers, and he was highly questionable coming into that game. He's been playing on both sides of the formation, but he was on the left side about 60 percent last week. That's where Blessuan Austin is playing, a second-year cornerback who's the more talented one of the Jets perimeter duo. Since being asked to play a bigger role towards the end of last year, he's allowed just 6.77 yards per target in his coverage and one touchdown on 43 targets. He's 6-foot-1 and 195 pounds, so he should be able to at least contest Pittman's targets. We're expecting a run-heavy gameplan from the Colts, but with Pittman being a full-time player, he needs to be considered most weeks.

He dropped what should've been a touchdown early in the game and played just 26 snaps against the Giants in a cake matchup. There were just three games he played less than 31 snaps in 2019, so his role has sadly not grown this year. The Falcons brought in Darqueze Dennard to cover the slot this year, but it hasn't panned out through two weeks, as he's allowed 16-of-20 passing for 160 yards through two weeks. Their entire cornerback unit is what I'd describe as below average. If Miller were to get the targets, he'd likely produce in this matchup, but we can't guarantee anything when he's playing less than 30 snaps.

Even worse is that Swift and Johnson have gotten two carries inside the 10-yard-line while Peterson has just one, which seems like it should be Peterson's role. This is going to be an ugly backfield to predict every week, though Swift should eventually establish himself as the top option. The Cardinals have surprisingly not allowed a running back more than 56 yards on the ground through two weeks. They limited Raheem Mostert to just 56 yards on 15 carries, though he did rattle off 95 yards and a touchdown through the air. Swift is clearly the preferred receiving option, as he's been in on 39 pass snaps, while Peterson and Johnson have combined for 33. Running backs have accounted for 50 percent of fantasy production against the Cardinals, which ranks as the third-highest in the league, so if the Lions are going to come anywhere close to their 24.5-point implied total, someone is likely to have value. Swift would be my choice, but as you can see, there's no guarantee. Treat him as a low-end RB3 and hope he finds his way into the end zone or sees quite a few targets. Peterson is getting the most touches but if he's not locked into goal-line work, he won't offer much upside at all. He's nothing more than a RB4 who's got a limited ceiling.

The Chargers have surprisingly gone with Michael Davis on the perimeter and moved Chris Harris Jr. into the slot over Desmond King, who's been a sturdy presence in the slot over the last few years. King even went to social media this week, asking why he's not on the field. It's a good question. Davis is a former undrafted free agent who's been competent, but Harris proved last year he's capable of handling perimeter receivers, so why then don't go with a combination of Casey Hayward, Harris, and King? I don't know. But Harris is a real problem for Samuel, as he's one of the best cornerback in the league. He got burned on a 54-yard touchdown last week, but it required an insane throw by Patrick Mahomes to get done, something we won't see Bridgewater doing.

The Giants have done a good job with tight ends over the first couple weeks, as Eric Ebron and Jimmy Graham both finished with exactly one catch for 18 yards.

The Rams allowed stud nickel cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman to walk in free agency, leaving them to start Troy Hill in his place. There was a point in Hill's career where he was a cornerback you targeted heavily in matchups, as he was allowing over a 110 QB Rating in his coverage during his first four years in the league.

Some will think Gallman was inactive due to being behind Lewis on the depth chart, but it was more to do with the type of players they are. Lewis complimented Barkley, while Gallman is more of a backup. Freeman didn't look good with the Falcons last year, so many want to leave him for dead. There are others who say, \"If Barkley couldn't produce behind the Giants offensive line, why do you want any of these guys?\" It's not an apples-to-apples comparison. Teams gameplan differently when Barkley is in there versus when Dion Lewis is in there. Remember last year when Gallman filled in for Barkley against Washington and totaled 27.8 PPR points? That doesn't make him better. The 49ers run defense isn't as scary as it was just one week ago, as they've lost a lot of firepower on their defensive line, as both Nick Bosa and Solomon Thomas are both out for the season. To this point, they've allowed just 0.67 PPR points per opportunity to running backs, which ranks as the eighth-lowest mark in the league, though we must remember that one of those games was against the Jets and their incompetent offense. We can't pretend the Giants offense has been much better, as they've totaled just 55 yards on 30 carries this season and have scored just 29 points as a team through two games. If you wanted to play one, Freeman would be my choice, though trusting him as anything more than an RB4 could lead to disappointment as he's learning a new offense on the fly. Lewis is nothing more than a change of pace running back at this stage, though he'll get some work in the passing game with the void left by Barkley. Lewis is a low-upside RB4\/5-type option. As for Gallman, he's the dark horse to be the best option on the team.

We watched Drew Sample and C.J. Uzomah rack up the fantasy points against them in Week 2, so it's not like Mark Andrews did all the damage.

It seems likely that he'll see the most of Giants top cornerback James Bradberry, who's done extremely well in his new uniform. Both Allen Robinson and Diontae Johnson both saw at least nine targets, but neither of them topped 57 yards. Bourne moves back and forth, so it's possible he sees a 50\/50 mix of Bradberry and Corey Ballentine, who's been the weakest link to this point.

Michel has picked up right where he left off last year, averaging just 3.3 yards per carry and not catching a single pass. It's brutal, too, as Cam Newton's presence should be opening holes up for him. It's worth noting that he's faced 8-plus man defensive fronts on 41.2 percent of his carries, which is the fourth-highest mark in the league. According to NFL's NextGenStats, he's getting almost exactly what he's been expected to, though that doesn't soak up fantasy owners' tears. In a game they're six-point favorites against a team that has allowed 4.66 yards per carry and four rushing touchdowns on just 41 carries, he must be under consideration as a mid-to-low-end RB3 who comes with touchdown upside. Guys, Newton isn't going to rush for two touchdowns every game. That same Raiders team that's allowed a lot of rushing totals has allowed a massive 9.83 targets to running backs, and that's something we continually saw last year, as they allowed the fourth-most fantasy points through the air to running backs. We don't know how much White will be involved, so it's a tough week to rank him, but given the matchup, he should offer high-end RB4 value in PPR formats.

The way to see that is that Montgomery is the leader in essentially a 55\/45 timeshare. That's not great considering the Bears are 2-0 and the gamescript fit his role perfectly in Week 2. He's run extremely well, averaging 5.0 yards per carry, and made a few shifty moves in the open field last week that led to a 28-yard receiving touchdown, but will those positive gamescripts continue? They are three-point underdogs in this game, and the Falcons have stopped the run extremely well considering their competition. Despite playing against Ezekiel Elliott and Chris Carson, they've allowed just 3.45 yards per carry through two weeks. There seem to be a variety of ways to score, though, as Carson caught two touchdowns, Elliott rushed for one, while Dak Prescott rushed for three. Montgomery is going to get the goal-line, which is the positive here, as the Bears are implied for 22 points. Where the Falcons struggle is to limit running backs through the air, as they've allowed 15-of-16 passes to be completed for 85 yards and two touchdowns. Since Dan Quinn became the Falcons coach, they've allowed an average of 6.4 receptions per game to running backs. Montgomery can have his role diminish in a highly negative gamescript, though oddsmakers have this as a close game. Plug him in as a low-end RB2 this week. Cohen is officially someone I'm worried about with just three targets through two games. Montgomery has six targets. Heck, Javon Wims has four targets. Cohen is not an early-down back who's going to grind out a high yards per carry. If he's not getting the targets, you can't use him in fantasy.

The Seahawks were horrendous against tight ends last year, but went out and traded for Jamal Adams this offseason, which certainly helped. While slowing Ryan Izzo was no tough task, the Seahawks held Hayden Hurst to just three catches for 38 yards in their first game, and it took a circus grab for him to make it over 15 yards. A league-low 9.2 percent of targets have gone to the tight end position against the Seahawks to this point.

When the ball is in his hands, Carson looks good... refreshed. They're working to get him in space in the passing game, too, which certainly raises his floor. The Cowboys have faced a league-high 65 rushing attempts through two weeks, but they haven't allowed a whole lot of efficiency, as they've allowed just 3.40 yards per carry and 1.30 PPR points per target. That amounts to just 0.61 PPR points per opportunity to this point, which is the third-lowest mark in the league. While the Cowboys were a team to run the ball against last year, things change under a new coordinator, and Mike Nolan has apparently put more emphasis on stopping the run. Carson should still be started as a high-end RB2, but just know that running backs haven't been particularly efficient against them to this point.

Hines totaled 15 touches in a game that was close throughout with Marlon Mack in the lineup for 1.5 quarters, but then totaled one touch in a game where Mack was on injured reserve. Cool story, Colts. Meanwhile, Taylor didn't see a single carry until the mid-second quarter in Week 1, but then received 26 carries in Week 2. I really hope there's more clarity this week, as it makes no sense to me. The only explanation is that Hines doesn't have a role when the Colts are well ahead, which is why they gave Jordan Wilkins nine carries in Week 2. They're double-digit favorites this week. What happens when your offense averages 68.0 plays per game and your opponent allows 70.0 plays per game? Fantasy points, that's what. The Jets run defense has been very good under Gregg Williams, as they allowed just 3.12 yards per carry through 17 games coming into Week 2. The wheels came off against the 49ers in that game though, as they allowed a few big runs that netted 184 yards and two touchdowns on 27 carries. There's a lot to dissect here because the Jets aren't the same defense they were last year, as they've lost safety Jamal Adams and linebacker C.J. Mosley this offseason. Things can change quickly with teams trending in the direction the Jets are, so when you factor that in, combined with a 27-point team-implied total, Taylor is a must-start high-end RB2 who can reach top-five numbers if last week was a sign of things to come for the Jets. Hines is a lot trickier because the gamescript should be similar to last week's game where he got exactly one touch. It's starting to feel like a Tarik Cohen situation where you want him used more than he actually is. The Jets did allow the 11th-most fantasy points through the air to running backs last year, but again, Hines needs touches to get there. Consider him an RB4 where we hope last week was a fluke.","tag":null,"recommendation":null,"pos_rank":"RB45"},{"player_id":18587,"player_name":"Mecole Hardman","sportsdata_id":"fe6dc768-d576-476c-b150-53b85af2a1d1","player_team_id":"KC","player_position_id":"WR","player_positions":"WR","player_short_name":"M.

Four targets, one catch, and five yards later, we're wondering what happened. Now on to play the Colts, who have allowed just 11 yards to tight ends this year... on seven targets. They weren't a matchup to target with tight ends last year, as they allowed just one tight end all year finish with more than 14.0 PPR points, and none of them finished with more than 73 yards. It's hard saying Herndon doesn't have any appeal considering the targets have to go somewhere, but as we found out last week, it's hardly a guarantee they go his way. It does help that the Colts just placed Malik Hooker on injured reserve, which hurts their safety combo.

In this game against Washington, it's tough to see that being the case with the Browns favored by almost a full touchdown. The one positive for Hooper, however, is that of the production Washington has allowed to skill-position players, 28.5 percent of it has gone to tight ends, which ranks as the third-highest mark in the league.

This is going to be an ugly backfield to predict every week, though Swift should eventually establish himself as the top option.

They limited Raheem Mostert to just 56 yards on 15 carries, though he did rattle off 95 yards and a touchdown through the air. Swift is clearly the preferred receiving option, as he's been in on 39 pass snaps, while Peterson and Johnson have combined for 33. Running backs have accounted for 50 percent of fantasy production against the Cardinals, which ranks as the third-highest in the league, so if the Lions are going to come anywhere close to their 24.5-point implied total, someone is likely to have value.

When playing the Bengals, the gap between running backs and quarterbacks is 24.6 fantasy points, which is the second-highest gap in the league. Despite the additions the Bengals made this offseason, they still appear to be a team you can run the ball against, as Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt showcased on primetime last week. We watched the Chargers and Browns both rack up at least 32 carries in this matchup, which bodes well for Sanders, and maybe even Scott. The Bengals allowed 19 running backs to finish as top-20 options against them last year and have allowed three of them through two games in 2020. The Eagles offensive line is a problem, but we can't pretend that the Browns or Washington have offensive lines that are great, and they were able to make it work. Start Sanders as an RB1 in this matchup. Scott touched the ball seven times in Sanders' return to the lineup, which isn't great, but what is great is the fact that it was only those two (Sanders and Scott) who touched the ball. If we get anywhere close to the 35 touches per game running backs have averaged against the Bengals here, Scott could offer last-minute RB4 value, especially in PPR formats.","tag":null,"recommendation":null,"pos_rank":"RB48"},{"player_id":11477,"player_name":"Chris Hogan","sportsdata_id":"8fc65820-f565-44e2-8635-3e1cdf165bf6","player_team_id":"FA","player_position_id":"WR","player_positions":"WR","player_short_name":"C.

The issue, of course, is that Howard is getting the goal-line opportunities, stealing any sort of ceiling for someone like Gaskin. The Jaguars have surprised early in the season, allowing Derrick Henry and Jonathan Taylor to combine for just 106 yards on 34 carries (3.12 yards per carry) and no touchdowns. They did allow the Colts running backs to combine for a ridiculous 17 catches for 142 yards and a touchdown in the Week 1 meeting, which clearly benefits someone like Gaskin, who has the passing-down role locked up with 11 targets through two weeks, while Breida has just two. The 7.40 yards per target the Jaguars allowed to running backs was the third-highest mark in the league, too. If you play in a PPR format, Gaskin can be considered a back-end RB3 for those dealing with injuries; just understand he doesn't come with a massive ceiling. The Jaguars have allowed at least 20 points to their opponents in nine of their last 10 games, so there should be a chance at Howard stealing a touchdown, but even then, what do you get?

We can't expect Minshew to throw the ball 45 times every week, especially in a game they're favored to win. The Dolphins haven't really been tested up the middle with tight ends to this point, as Ryan Izzo and Dawson Knox combined to see just five targets. Don't go assuming that Eifert is going to get targeted more than them, either, as he received just one target in Week 1. He's never going to be someone you'll stream confidently, as he's just a touchdown dependent option.

But there have been 15 targets to the two of them through two weeks, amounting to a respectable 22.1 percent target share. The Steelers have allowed just a 52.9 percent catch-rate to tight ends through two games, which is much different than the 69.9 percent completion rate they allowed in 2019. They actually allowed 1.93 PPR points per target to tight ends last year, which was the fifth-highest mark in the league, but they faced the fourth-fewest targets, so their overall numbers looked better. With how dominant they are against running backs and wide receivers, it's only natural to expect them to have some sort of weakness. If Will Fuller is held out, the target floor goes up for Akins, but even if he plays, Akins is on the high-end TE2 radar.

The Jaguars have surprised early in the season, allowing Derrick Henry and Jonathan Taylor to combine for just 106 yards on 34 carries (3.12 yards per carry) and no touchdowns. They did allow the Colts running backs to combine for a ridiculous 17 catches for 142 yards and a touchdown in the Week 1 meeting, which clearly benefits someone like Gaskin, who has the passing-down role locked up with 11 targets through two weeks, while Breida has just two. The 7.40 yards per target the Jaguars allowed to running backs was the third-highest mark in the league, too. If you play in a PPR format, Gaskin can be considered a back-end RB3 for those dealing with injuries; just understand he doesn't come with a massive ceiling. The Jaguars have allowed at least 20 points to their opponents in nine of their last 10 games, so there should be a chance at Howard stealing a touchdown, but even then, what do you get? He's nothing more than a touchdown-hopeful RB4\/5. Breida is the forgotten man whose role falls in between those of Gaskin and Howard.","tag":null,"recommendation":null,"pos_rank":"RB50"},{"player_id":17254,"player_name":"James Washington","sportsdata_id":"814aa074-fc61-4649-b7a1-098bd3a199fd","player_team_id":"PIT","player_position_id":"WR","player_positions":"WR","player_short_name":"J.

Some will think Gallman was inactive due to being behind Lewis on the depth chart, but it was more to do with the type of players they are. Lewis complimented Barkley, while Gallman is more of a backup. Freeman didn't look good with the Falcons last year, so many want to leave him for dead. There are others who say, \"If Barkley couldn't produce behind the Giants offensive line, why do you want any of these guys?\" It's not an apples-to-apples comparison. Teams gameplan differently when Barkley is in there versus when Dion Lewis is in there. Remember last year when Gallman filled in for Barkley against Washington and totaled 27.8 PPR points? That doesn't make him better. The 49ers run defense isn't as scary as it was just one week ago, as they've lost a lot of firepower on their defensive line, as both Nick Bosa and Solomon Thomas are both out for the season. To this point, they've allowed just 0.67 PPR points per opportunity to running backs, which ranks as the eighth-lowest mark in the league, though we must remember that one of those games was against the Jets and their incompetent offense. We can't pretend the Giants offense has been much better, as they've totaled just 55 yards on 30 carries this season and have scored just 29 points as a team through two games. If you wanted to play one, Freeman would be my choice, though trusting him as anything more than an RB4 could lead to disappointment as he's learning a new offense on the fly. Lewis is nothing more than a change of pace running back at this stage, though he'll get some work in the passing game with the void left by Barkley. Lewis is a low-upside RB4\/5-type option. As for Gallman, he's the dark horse to be the best option on the team. If for whatever reason Freeman is inactive due to just a few days with the team, Gallman would take his place.","tag":null,"recommendation":null,"pos_rank":"RB51"},{"player_id":18609,"player_name":"Benny Snell Jr.","sportsdata_id":"74af3906-083e-49d1-b8c6-556101390381","player_team_id":"PIT","player_position_id":"RB","player_positions":"RB","player_short_name":"B.

I figured they'd give Conner another chance and he played well, compiling 121 total yards and a touchdown on 18 touches while Snell totaled exactly one yard on his four touches. This is Conner's backfield, but the Steelers will show no hesitance no move away from him if he's inefficient or dealing with an injury. There was no team in the NFL who allowed more fantasy points on the ground than the Texans last year, and it wasn't all that close, as the Chiefs were a full 16 PPR points behind them at No. 2. It wasn't just on the ground, either. They allowed a massive 1.98 PPR points per target through the air, which ranked second to only the Dolphins. When you have those numbers combined with a running back who'll likely see 18-plus opportunities, it's a recipe for big success. Both the Chiefs and Ravens rushed for more than 160 yards in their matchups against them, so there's little reason to doubt the Steelers backs. Play Conner as a low-end RB1 and as long as he stays upright, he should crush this matchup.","tag":null,"recommendation":null,"pos_rank":"RB52"},{"player_id":16757,"player_name":"David Moore","sportsdata_id":"aecc1809-4628-4c3a-8b2b-c8f2858d2492","player_team_id":"CAR","player_position_id":"WR","player_positions":"WR","player_short_name":"D.

If you saw his highlight reel catch last week, you'll know that his targets aren't going away. Against the Saints, the Packers will need to get creative, as this is a team that shuts down running games. They've allowed just 3.41 yards per carry on the year with one touchdown on 54 carries, and it's nothing new, as they ranked as the No. 6 team against running backs last year while allowing 3.65 yards per carry. The 145.9 fantasy points they allowed on the ground ranked as the third-best behind only the Patriots and Bucs. The 181.8 PPR points they allowed through the air to running backs was a lot better, as that was the 10th-most in football. Jones has now seen at least six targets in each of the last three regular seasons he's played. If Davante Adams is out or limited, that number should be safe. This is not going to be an explosion game on the ground, but as I've been saying since this offseason, Jones is very similar to Alvin Kamara in that he's highly efficient, even if he doesn't get 20-plus touches per game like some top-tier backs. Start him as a low-end RB1 in this matchup. Williams has surprisingly seen 19 touches over the first two games, but only four have been targets. In a matchup with the Saints, I don't want to take his touches, as they offer a very low ceiling.","tag":null,"recommendation":null,"pos_rank":"RB53"},{"player_id":15665,"player_name":"Demarcus Robinson","sportsdata_id":"46b16198-116f-4913-85db-2bc21462bd66","player_team_id":"KC","player_position_id":"WR","player_positions":"WR","player_short_name":"D.

The matchup over the middle of the field against the Bills was one to attack, and the Dolphins did just that, as Ford racked up seven receptions for 76 yards. The Jaguars have D.J. Hayden covering the slot, a role he's been quite good in over the last few years. The biggest game he allowed to a slot receiver last year was six catches for 93 scoreless yards.

I'll be honest, I didn't like Fournette at his third-round price, but as a back-end RB2? Absolutely. Robinson has totaled 32 of the team's 34 running back carries and has averaged 5.1 yards per carry on them. With how well the receivers and Minshew are playing, he should continue to find holes. The Dolphins are clearly a team to run the ball against, as the weak running back units of the Patriots and Bills combined for 212 yards and a touchdown on 44 carries over the last two weeks. You'd have to go all the way back to Week 10 of last year to find the last time the Dolphins didn't allow at least 21 points to their opponent. When you combine that with the team-implied total of 23.8 points, and Robinson should have a good shot to score in this game. Consider him a stable low-end RB2.

The Seahawks front seven is not a particularly good unit, and they got worse when they lost Bruce Irvin this week to an ACL injury, but they've allowed a league-low 92 rushing yards through two games. Playing against Todd Gurley and Sony Michel will help, though holding those two teams to just 2.88 yards per carry is an accomplishment. That's also likely why opponents have gone with a run play just 31.3 percent of the time against the Seahawks (second-lowest mark in the league), because their secondary can be picked on. But again, Elliott isn't in the same category as Gurley or Michel. There were 10 running backs who finished as the RB14 or better against them last year, including four 30-point performances.

The snaps are somewhat similar with Ingram leading the way with 48, Edwards 46, and Dobbins 43. It seems like Ingram is the one who they'll play the most when the game is close, Edwards is the closer, while Dobbins does everything in between, though that role has only led to 10 opportunities through two weeks. If he hadn't scored those two touchdowns in Week 1, he would be a running back with 83 total yards through two weeks. His role should continue to grow as the weeks go on, but he's a risky start at this moment. The Chiefs are a matchup to attack with running backs, as they've allowed 19 different running backs finish as the RB26 or better over their last 18 games. During last year's meeting, Mark Ingram exploded for 103 yards and three touchdowns on 16 carries and chipped in four receptions for 32 yards. That was the second-highest number of carries he had all season. His other two highest totals came against the Steelers and Patriots, so it's obvious they trust him in competitive situations, which this game will be. Ingram should be in lineups as a solid RB2 for this game with a good shot to score at least once. Dobbins is someone I understand the 'want' to play him more than I understand the process. He's a risky RB3\/4 option who will disappoint if he doesn't score. Edwards will have a bigger role if they blow out the Chiefs, but we're not expecting that, so he's not a recommended fantasy option.","tag":null,"recommendation":null,"pos_rank":"RB56"},{"player_id":19483,"player_name":"Van Jefferson","sportsdata_id":"8e1285f7-6e4c-41e4-aac9-92e09f9f32b2","player_team_id":"LAR","player_position_id":"WR","player_positions":"WR","player_short_name":"V.

He played just 18 snaps in the opener but watched that number grow to 43 snaps in Week 2, while Barber went from 29 offensive snaps to just one last week. Now, McKissic is clearly going to be a thorn in Gibson's side, as he's been consistent in his snaps and has totaled 16 opportunities through two weeks, but he's only going to lose momentum as the season goes on. The Browns run defense has played much better than anyone anticipated given their linebacking unit, as they've allowed just 2.97 yards per carry over the first two weeks to backfields much more talented than this one. The Ravens and Bengals running backs combined for just 38 carries in the two games combined, and no running back has rushed for more than 46 yards. With Gibson only seeing one target in a game they trailed throughout, he's still not getting enough opportunities to play as anything more than an RB3 but we're getting closer.

Some will think Gallman was inactive due to being behind Lewis on the depth chart, but it was more to do with the type of players they are. Lewis complimented Barkley, while Gallman is more of a backup. Freeman didn't look good with the Falcons last year, so many want to leave him for dead. There are others who say, \"If Barkley couldn't produce behind the Giants offensive line, why do you want any of these guys?\" It's not an apples-to-apples comparison. Teams gameplan differently when Barkley is in there versus when Dion Lewis is in there. Remember last year when Gallman filled in for Barkley against Washington and totaled 27.8 PPR points? That doesn't make him better. The 49ers run defense isn't as scary as it was just one week ago, as they've lost a lot of firepower on their defensive line, as both Nick Bosa and Solomon Thomas are both out for the season. To this point, they've allowed just 0.67 PPR points per opportunity to running backs, which ranks as the eighth-lowest mark in the league, though we must remember that one of those games was against the Jets and their incompetent offense. We can't pretend the Giants offense has been much better, as they've totaled just 55 yards on 30 carries this season and have scored just 29 points as a team through two games. If you wanted to play one, Freeman would be my choice, though trusting him as anything more than an RB4 could lead to disappointment as he's learning a new offense on the fly. Lewis is nothing more than a change of pace running back at this stage, though he'll get some work in the passing game with the void left by Barkley. Lewis is a low-upside RB4\/5-type option. As for Gallman, he's the dark horse to be the best option on the team. If for whatever reason Freeman is inactive due to just a few days with the team, Gallman would take his place.","tag":null,"recommendation":null,"pos_rank":"RB60"},{"player_id":16448,"player_name":"Brian Hill","sportsdata_id":"26873576-2bbd-4622-bc3e-ec847577855b","player_team_id":"TEN","player_position_id":"RB","player_positions":"RB","player_short_name":"B.

We are a fantasy football podcast that has grown organically through word-of-mouth and have accrued over 100,000 plays through Apple Podcasts, Spotify and SoundCloud. We are a unique podcast in that we are three brothers who discuss fantasy football in a way that only brothers can - while also being very knowledgeable and accurate. Our fanbase is growing and very loyal, as our hashtag (#InBRotoWeTrust) has become more and more popular among them. Furthermore, we have been expanding recently by bringing guests on to our show that have included Elliot Crist, from The Quant Edge, Thor Nystrom of Roto World, Scott Fish and Andy Singleton, creator of \"Draft With Giants,\" a growing best ball league in which \"giants\" and fans face off. In fact, we are currently in that tournament as \"giants.\" In addition, we are all competing in the Scott Fish Bowl 9, the largest tournament of its kind in the industry. \r\n\r\nIn addition to fantasy, I host the more general Veteran's Minimum podcast which has over 3.3 million plays. \r\n\r\nMichael and Jason Petropoulos, my brothers and cohosts, are already rankers on Fantasy Pros. I am reaching out today in the hopes that I may join your network of experts as well. I am looking to release weekly rankings and would love to have the opportunity to use your website as my new outlet. As a Fantasy Pro, I will proudly represent the brand to all of the loyal listeners we have built and release all of my rankings and written articles through your site. I would also love to contribute to the site in any way I can. \r\n\r\nThank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you. \r\n\r\nBest regards, \r\n\r\nTim Petropoulos \r\nThe BRoto Fantasy Podcast","last_updated":1601225958,"twitter_link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BRotoFFTim","twitter_handle":"@BRotoFFTim","rankings_link":"","draft_rank":"","in_season_rank":"113","in_season_ly_rank":"","accuracy_awards":[]},{"id":454,"name":"Joe Bond","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1006589462426501120\/prtR4aOg.jpg","site":"Fantasy Six Pack","site_link":"http:\/\/www.fantasysixpack.net\/","profile_link":"https:\/\/www.fantasypros.com\/experts\/joe-bond.php","bio":"Not just another \"Average Joe\" when it comes to Fantasy Sports, he is the fantasy brain trust behind the FantasySixPack.net website.
